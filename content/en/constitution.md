# Graduate Student Council Constitution

The Graduate Student Council (GSC) serves as the official representative body for all CSE graduate students. Our mission is to foster community, facilitate communication between students and faculty, organize events, and advocate for policies that benefit graduate student welfare. All enrolled CSE graduate students are automatic members with full voting rights and eligibility to run for office.

The GSC is governed by an Executive Board consisting of a President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary, elected annually in Spring Quarter. These officers coordinate all council activities, manage finances, maintain records, and serve as liaisons with department leadership. Regular meetings are held quarterly, with decisions requiring a quorum of the Executive Board.

Elections are conducted by secret ballot with a simple majority determining winners. The constitution may be amended by a two-thirds vote of members present at a meeting, followed by ratification by department leadership. All members have the right to attend meetings, vote in elections, run for office, and submit proposals.
